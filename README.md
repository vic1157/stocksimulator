## Introduction

The stock market is the apotheosis of the global financial system. Investors are able to gain ownership in promising companies and influence company direction depending on the amount and types of shares that one owns. While a belief in a company can serve as a catalyst in purchasing a stock, there are other variables that an investor should consider before purchasing a share in a company, such as

1. The stockâ€™s price history and trajectory
2. The earnings report of a company
3. Consumer confidence in company and industry that company resides
4. Expansion plans and opportunities for growth
5. Competition in industry or emerging startups


## Purpose
